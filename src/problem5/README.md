Problem 5
# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

- Create and Fill private datas in .env file

```shell
npm init
npx hardhat run scripts/test.js
```
